Theseus
=======

Theseus is a new type of JavaScript debugger that makes it easier (we hope!) to debug asynchronous code. Theseus works inside the code editor [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). Currently, however, it requires a special build of Brackets. This will hopefully change soon.

Theseus is part of a collaboration between the [UID group at MIT CSAIL](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/) and [Adobe Research](http://research.adobe.com/).
